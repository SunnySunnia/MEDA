# MEDA

[Osample.py](Osample.py) finds 20 (maximum I can get) businesses in the mission district, San Francisco.   
-->There has all the information about each business, but a problem is the format isnt really good.  
  --->I am trying to manually adjust the format in R.  

[Ooutput1.txt](Ooutput1.txt) is the output text file.

*Update

[mission.py](mission.py) is the script modified from the example given from the YelpAPI python module.
User can substitute search terms, search location in text or in lon-lan bounds, and search categories.

[mission.txt](mission.txt) is the corresponding resulting text file of the test search (can only obtain 20 results in each search)
