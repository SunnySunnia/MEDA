# MEDA

[Osample.py](Osample.py) finds 20 (maximum I can get) businesses in the mission district, San Francisco.   
-->There has all the information about each business, but a problem is the format isnt really good.  
  --->I am trying to manually adjust the format in R.  

[Ooutput1.txt](Ooutput1.txt) is the output text file.
